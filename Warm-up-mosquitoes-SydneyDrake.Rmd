# ABSTRACT

Fill in abstract at the end after we have finished the methods, results, discussion, conclusions and know what our data "says".

# BACKGROUND

The West Nile Virus (WNV) has been endemic in mainland United States since the late 1900s and has since achieved endemic status. Spread of this disease has been linked to mosquitoes and carried by birds. Specific species of birds have been shown to have high viremia of the WNV, making them a common host and link in human infection with this disease.
This study is focused on the link between House Finches and human WNV cases. Mosquito blood meal was taken from several locations, and data was compiled on those carrying the WNV and from what animal they took blood from. With the blood samples, PCR was performed and the resulting DNA was sequenced.
Our hypothesis addresses the extent of WNV cases in House Finches specifically, and their likelihood of passing the disease onto humans.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  
The question we will study and address is "What bird species is acting as WNV amplifying host in Salt Lake City?"

## Hypothesis 
Our hypothesis is that house finches are acting as important amplifying hosts of WNV in Salt Lake City. We hypothesize that this specific species is particularly suseptible to this disease and produces a high viremia in the blood.
  
## Prediction
We predict that, in the areas where mosquitoes commonly feed on house finches, trapped mosquitoes will have a higher rate of confirmed WNV in their systems.

## Fill in first analysis

Paragraph describing

```{r first-analysis, warning=FALSE}
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

par(op)

## Keep the colors mapping for reuse elsewhere
host_species_colors <- species_colors
```
## Fill in 2nd analysis/plot e.g. generalized linear model

Fill in here... Explain that you tested whether the presence or number of house finch blood meals predicts whether a site had WNV-positive pools (binary) or a higher WNV positivity rate (numeric). Mention that this statistical test lets you formally evaluate the relationship suggested by the barplots.

```{r}
# second-analysis-or-plot, glm with house finch alone against binary +/_
glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)

#glm with house-finch alone against positivity rate
glm2 <- glm(loc_rate ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix)
summary(glm2)
```
```

## Fill in second analysis/plot

glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)

#glm with house-finch alone against positivity rate
glm2 <- glm(loc_rate ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix)
